# Veterinary System

<p style="font-weight: bold">
The veterinary management system project is designed as API through which a veterinary clinic can manage its own affairs. It is intended to make it easy for the veterinarian, staff and clients to handle their transactions. Customizations such as animal vaccination information, appointment creation and vet availability have been made.</p>

# When creating this application, the relationships with the uma diagram were determined
